# Exploring Azure Data Services

This Level 200 session will introduce Microsoft Cosmos DB, Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Factory focusing on dealing with data in a micro-service world.
 
**Cosmos DB** is a global distributed database service for extremely low latency and massively scalable applications anywhere in the world, with native support for NoSQL. (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db)
**Data Lake** is a no-limits data lake to power intelligent action with support for Petabyte-size files and trillions of objects. (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-lake-store/)
**Data Factory** is a hybrid data integration service that allows you to create, schedule and orchestrate your ETL/ELT workflows at scale wherever your data lives, in cloud or self-hosted network. (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/)

In this session we will be looking at the features of Cosmos DB, in particular SQL DocumentDB, and what it means to built applications that use Cosmos. Then, weâ€™ll explore syncing data from the Cosmos DB to the Data Lake in real-time using a Function App. To wrap up, we explore some analytical features of Data Lakes and see how the Data Factory can be used to schedule tasks against the Data Lake.
